   Clarification of Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST): transfer
                          encodings and ASN.1
              draft-richardson-lamps-rfc7030est-clarify-01

Abstract

   This document updates RFC7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
   to resolve some errata that was reported, and which has proven to
   have interoperability when RFC7030 has been extended.

   This document deprecates the specification of "Content-Transfer-
   Encoding" headers for EST endpoints, providing a way to do this in an
   upward compatible way.  This document additional defines a GRASP
   discovery mechanism for EST endpoints, and specifies requirements for
   them.

   Finally, this document fixes some syntactical errors in ASN.1 that
   was presented.

1.  Introduction

   {[RFC7030}} defines the Enrollment over Secure Transport, or EST
   protocol.

   This specification defines a number of HTTP end points for
   certificate enrollment and management.  The details of the
   transaction were defined in terms of MIME headers as defined in
   [RFC2045], rather than in terms of the HTTP protocol as defined in
   [RFC2616] and [RFC7230].

   [RFC2616] has text specifically deprecating Content-Transfer-
   Encoding.  [RFC7030] calls it out this header incorrectly.

   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] extends [RFC7030], adding new
   functionality, and interop testing of the protocol has revealed that
   unusual processing called out in [RFC7030] causes confusion.

Internet-Draft                 rfc7030est                      June 2019


   EST is currently specified as part of IEC 62351, and is widely used
   in Government, Utilities and Financial markets today.

   Changes to [RFC7030] to bring it inline with typical HTTP processing
   would change the on-wire protocol in a way that is not backwards
   compatible.  Reports from the field suggest that many implementations
   do not send the Content-Transfer-Encoding, and many of them ignore
   it.

   This document therefore revises [RFC7030] to reflect the field
   reality, deprecating the extranous field.

   This document deals with errata numbers [errata4384], [errata5107],
   and [errata5108].

2.  Terminology

   The abbreviation "CTE" is used to denote the Content-Transfer-
   Encoding header, and the abbreviation "CTE-base64" is used to denote
   a request or response whose Content-Transfer-Encoding header contains
   the value "base64".

3.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

4.  Changes to EST endpoint processing

   The [RFC7030] sections 4.1.3 (CA Certificates Response, /cacerts),
   4.3.1/4.3.2 (Full CMC, /fullcmc), 4.4.2 (Server-Side Key Generation,
   /serverkeygen), and 4.5.2 (CSR Attributes, /csrattrs) specify the use
   of base64 encoding with a Content-Transsfer-Encoding for requests and
   response.

   This document updates [RFC7030] to require the POST request and
   payload response of all endpoints in to be [RFC4648] section 4 Base64
   encoded DER.  This format is to be used regardless of whether there
   is any Content-Transfer-Encoding header, and any value in that header
   is to be ignored.

5.  Clarification of ASN.1 for Certificate Attribute set.

   errata 4384.

6.  Clarification of error messages for certificate enrollment
    operations

   errata 5108.

7.  Definition of GRASP discovery for updated EST servers

   An ANIMA ACP device can discover the location of the nearest EST
   server using a [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp-api] M_DISCOVERY mechanism.

   objective = ["AN_EST", F_DISC, 255 ]

8.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not disclose any additional identifies to either
   active or passive observer would see with [RFC7030].

9.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies an existing security mechanism.  An option is
   introduced to the security mechanism using an implicit negotiation.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate the name AN_EST from the [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp-api] "GRASP
   Objective Names Table".
