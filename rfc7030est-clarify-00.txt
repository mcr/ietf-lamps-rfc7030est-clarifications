   Clarification of Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST): transfer
                          encodings and ASN.1
              draft-richardson-lamps-rfc7030est-clarify-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
   to resolve some errata that was reported, and which has proven to
   have interoperability when RFC7030 has been extended.

   This document deprecates the specification of "Content-Transfer-
   Encoding" headers for EST endpoints, providing a way to do this in an
   upward compatible way.  This document additional defines a GRASP
   discovery mechanism for EST endpoints, and specifies requirements for
   them.

   Finally, this document fixes some syntactical errors in ASN.1 that
   was presented.

1.  Introduction

   {[RFC7030}} defines the Enrollment over Secure Transport, or EST
   protocol.

   This specification defines a number of HTTP end points for
   certificate enrollment and management.  The details of the
   transaction were defined in terms of MIME headers as defined in
   [RFC2045], rather than in terms of the HTTP protocol as defined in
   [RFC2616] and [RFC7230].

   [RFC2616] has text specifically deprecating Content-Transfer-
   Encoding.  [RFC7030] calls it out this header incorrectly.

   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] extends [RFC7030], adding new
   functionality, and interop testing of the protocol has revealed that
   unusual processing called out in [RFC7030] causes confusion.

   Changes to [RFC7030] to bring it inline with typical HTTP processing
   would change the on-wire protocol in a way that is not backwards
   compatible.  This document provides a compromise that moves towards
   the correct behaviour without breaking existing deployments.

   This document deals with errata numbers [errata4384], [errata5107],
   and [errata5108].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the term "amended server" to refer to an EST
   server that complies with the changes in this document.  The term
   "legacy EST server" refers to servers that do not support the changes
   in this document.

   The term "BRSKI EST server" refers to an EST server that also
   supports the mechanisms described in
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

   The abbreviation "CTE" is used to denote the Content-Transfer-
   Encoding header, and the abbreviation "CTE-base64" is used to denote
   a request or response whose Content-Transfer-Encoding header contains
   the value "base64".

3.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

4.  Changes to EST endpoint processing

   [RFC7030] sections 4.1.3 (CA Certificates Response, /cacerts),
   4.3.1/4.3.2 (Full CMC, /fullcmc), 4.4.2 (Server-Side Key Generation,
   /serverkeygen), and 4.5.2 (CSR Attributes, /csrattrs) specify the use
   of base64 encoding with a Content-Transsfer-Encoding for requests and
   response.

   Both section 4.1.3 (CA certificate response), and Section 4.5.2,
   /csrattrs is a GET operation, and will be dealt with below.

   For the other three methods, when the client is aware that this is an
   amended server then it SHOULD send the POST request in binary form
   (DER-encoded), and omit the Content-Transfer-Encoding header.  How
   the client knows what kind of server it is dealing with is
   communicating with is detailed in the next section.

   An amended server, when it receives a request that has no Content-
   Transfer-Encoding header, or has a Content-Transfer-Encoding header
   with the "binary" attribute, MUST respond in the same binary format.

   When an amended server receives a request in CTE-base64 form, then it
   MAY respond in kind.  It is reasonable for a server to be configured
   to ignore or fail requests of this form, either via run-time
   configuration, or via a compile-time option.  A main reason to do
   this is to avoid a permutation that requires testing in the future
   when no legacy EST clients are expected to connect.

4.1.  Client configuration

   [RFC7030] has some significant deployment.  The protocol has no
   version numbers or other ways to indicate that the format of the
   operations has changed, and as the protocol is driven by a client
   state machine, the client has to know whether it has to operate in
   legacy EST server mode.

   In certain market verticals it may be well known to client system
   designers whether or not this is the case.  In those cases, the out-
   of-band configuration mechanism is appropriate.

   Clients that start their process using
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] SHOULD assume that the server
   supports this amended specification.

   Clients that discover an EST server in an ANIMA ACP via GRASP, using
   the mechanism detailed in Section 7 SHOULD also assume that these
   servers support this amended specification.

   Other users or extensions for [RFC7030] should specify if clients are
   to assume this amended specification or not.

4.2.  Retrieval of certificate attributes

   The 4.5.2 (CSR Attributes, /csrattrs) is a GET operation.  It occurs
   at the beginning of a transaction.

   TBD how can the client indicate it is willing to accept an un-encoded
   response?

   The 4.1.3 (CA Certificates Response, /cacerts) is also a GET
   operation, but it occurs after enrollment.  The server SHOULD assume
   that a client that wanted a binary response also wants a binary
   response here.

5.  Clarification of ASN.1 for Certificate Attribute set.

   errata 4384.

6.  Clarification of error messages for certificate enrollment
    operations

   errata 5108.

7.  Definition of GRASP discovery for updated EST servers

   An ANIMA ACP device can discover the location of the nearest EST
   server using a [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp-api] M_DISCOVERY mechanism.

   objective = ["AN_EST", F_DISC, 255 ]

   EST servers discovered in this way MUST support the amended server
   mechanism described in this document.  The response will include a
   hostname and port number for a nearby EST server that can be used to
   renew an ACP credential.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not disclose any additional identifies to either
   active or passive observer would see with [RFC7030].

9.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies an existing security mechanism.  An option is
   introduced to the security mechanism using an implicit negotiation.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Allocate the name AN_EST from the [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp-api] "GRASP
   Objective Names Table".
