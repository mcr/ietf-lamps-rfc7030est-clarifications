Abstract

   This document updates RFC7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
   to resolve some errata that was reported, and which has proven to
   cause interoperability issues when RFC7030 was extended.

   This document deprecates the specification of "Content-Transfer-
   Encoding" headers for EST endpoints.  This document fixes some
   syntactical errors in ASN.1 that was presented.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7030] defines the Enrollment over Secure Transport, or EST
   protocol.

   This specification defines a number of HTTP end points for
   certificate enrollment and management.  The details of the
   transaction were defined in terms of MIME headers as defined in
   [RFC2045], rather than in terms of the HTTP protocol as defined in
   [RFC2616] and [RFC7230].

   [RFC2616] and later [RFC7231] Appendix A.5 has text specifically
   deprecating Content-Transfer-Encoding.  However, [RFC7030]
   incorrectly uses this header.

   Changes to [RFC7030] to bring it inline with typical HTTP processing
   risk changes the on-wire protocol in a way that is not backwards



Richardson, et al.      Expires October 27, 2020                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                 rfc7030est                     April 2020


   compatible.  However, reports from the implementers suggest that many
   implementations do not send the Content-Transfer-Encoding, and many
   of them ignore it.  The consequence is that simply deprecating the
   header would remain compatible with current implementations.

   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] extends [RFC7030], adding new
   functionality, and interop testing of the protocol has revealed that
   unusual processing called out in [RFC7030] causes confusion.

   EST is currently specified as part of [IEC62351], and is widely used
   in Government, Utilities and Financial markets today.

   This document therefore revises [RFC7030] to reflect the field
   reality, deprecating the extranous field.

   This document deals with errata numbers [errata4384], [errata5107],
   [errata5108], and [errata5904].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Changes to EST endpoint processing

   The [RFC7030] sections 4.1.3 (CA Certificates Response, /cacerts),
   4.3.1/4.3.2 (Full CMC, /fullcmc), 4.4.2 (Server-Side Key Generation,
   /serverkeygen), and 4.5.2 (CSR Attributes, /csrattrs) specify the use
   of base64 encoding with a Content-Transfer-Encoding for requests and
   response.

   This document updates [RFC7030] to require the POST request and
   payload response of all endpoints use Base64 encoding as specified in
   Section 4 of [RFC4648].  In both cases, the Distinguished Encoding
   Rules (DER) [X690] are used to produce the input for the Base64
   encoding routine.  This format is to be used regardless of any
   Content-Transfer-Encoding header, and any value in such a header MUST
   be ignored.

3.1.  Whitespace processing

   Note that "base64" as used in the HTTP [RFC2616] does not permit
   CRLF, while the "base64" used in MIME [RFC2045] does.  This
   specification clarifies that despite [RFC2616], that white space
   including CR, LF, spaces (ASCII 32) and, tabs (ASCII 9) should be

   tolerated by receivers.  Senders are not required to insert any kind
   of white space.

4.  Clarification of ASN.1 for Certificate Attribute set.

   Section 4.5.2 of [RFC7030] is to be replaced with the following text:

4.1.  CSR Attributes Response

   If locally configured policy for an authenticated EST client
   indicates a CSR Attributes Response is to be provided, the server
   response MUST include an HTTP 200 response code.  An HTTP response
   code of 204 or 404 indicates that a CSR Attributes Response is not
   available.  Regardless of the response code, the EST server and CA
   MAY reject any subsequent enrollment requests for any reason, e.g.,
   incomplete CSR attributes in the request.

   Responses to attribute request messages MUST be encoded as the
   content-type of "application/csrattrs", and are to be "base64"
   [RFC2045] encoded.  The syntax for application/csrattrs body is as
   follows:

   CsrAttrs ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (0..MAX) OF AttrOrOID

   AttrOrOID ::= CHOICE {
     oid        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
     attribute  Attribute {{AttrSet}} }

   AttrSet ATTRIBUTE ::= { aa-asymDecryptKeyId, ... }

   An EST server includes zero or more OIDs or attributes [RFC2986] that
   it requests the client to use in the certification request.  The
   client MUST ignore any OID or attribute it does not recognize.  When
   the server encodes CSR Attributes as an empty SEQUENCE, it means that
   the server has no specific additional information it desires in a
   client certification request (this is functionally equivalent to an
   HTTP response code of 204 or 404).

   If the CA requires a particular cryptographic algorithm or use of a
   particular signature scheme (e.g., certification of a public key
   based on a certain elliptic curve, or signing using a certain hash
   algorithm) it MUST provide that information in the CSR Attribute
   Response.  If an EST server requires the linking of identity and POP
   information (see Section 3.5), it MUST include the challengePassword
   OID in the CSR Attributes Response.

   The structure of the CSR Attributes Response SHOULD, to the greatest
   extent possible, reflect the structure of the CSR it is requesting.

Internet-Draft                 rfc7030est                     April 2020


   Requests to use a particular signature scheme (e.g. using a
   particular hash function) are represented as an OID to be reflected
   in the SignatureAlgorithm of the CSR.  Requests to use a particular
   cryptographic algorithm (e.g., certification of a public key based on
   a certain elliptic curve) are represented as an attribute, to be
   reflected as the AlgorithmIdentifier of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
   with a type indicating the algorithm and the values indicating the
   particular parameters specific to the algorithm.  Requests for
   descriptive information from the client are made by an attribute, to
   be represented as Attributes of the CSR, with a type indicating the
   [RFC2985] extensionRequest and the values indicating the particular
   attributes desired to be included in the resulting certificate's
   extensions.

   The sequence is Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoded [X690] and
   then base64 encoded (Section 4 of [RFC4648]).  The resulting text
   forms the application/csrattr body, without headers.

   For example, if a CA requests a client to submit a certification
   request containing the challengePassword (indicating that linking of
   identity and POP information is requested; see Section 3.5), an
   extensionRequest with the Media Access Control (MAC) address
   ([RFC2307]) of the client, and to use the secp384r1 elliptic curve
   and to sign with the SHA384 hash function.  Then, it takes the
   following:

         OID:        challengePassword (1.2.840.113549.1.9.7)

         Attribute:  type = extensionRequest (1.2.840.113549.1.9.14)
                     value = macAddress (1.3.6.1.1.1.1.22)

         Attribute:  type = id-ecPublicKey (1.2.840.10045.2.1)
                     value = secp384r1 (1.3.132.0.34)

         OID:        ecdsaWithSHA384 (1.2.840.10045.4.3.3)

   and encodes them into an ASN.1 SEQUENCE to produce:

       30 41 06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 09 07 30 12 06 07 2a 86 48 ce 3d
       02 01 31 07 06 05 2b 81 04 00 22 30 16 06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01
       09 0e 31 09 06 07 2b 06 01 01 01 01 16 06 08 2a 86 48 ce 3d 04 03
       03

   and then base64 encodes the resulting ASN.1 SEQUENCE to produce:

       MEEGCSqGSIb3DQEJBzASBgcqhkjOPQIBMQcGBSuBBAAiMBYGCSqGSIb3DQEJDjEJ

5.  Clarification of error messages for certificate enrollment
    operations

   [errata5108] clarifies what format the error messages are to be in.
   Previously a client might be confused into believing that an error
   returned with type text/plain was not intended to be an error.

5.1.  Updating section 4.2.3: Simple Enroll and Re-enroll Response

   Replace:

       If the content-type is not set, the response data MUST be a
       plaintext human-readable error message containing explanatory
       information describing why the request was rejected (for
       example, indicating that CSR attributes are incomplete).

   with:

       If the content-type is not set, the response data must be a
       plaintext human-readable error message containing explanatory
       information describing why the request was rejected (for
       example, indicating that CSR attributes are incomplete).
       Servers MAY use the "text/plain" content-type [RFC2046]
       for human-readable errors.

5.2.  Updating section 4.4.2: Server-Side Key Generation Response

   Replace:

       If the content-type is not set, the response data MUST be a
       plaintext human-readable error message.

   with:

       If the content-type is not set, the response data must be a
       plaintext human-readable error message.
       Servers MAY use the "text/plain" content-type [RFC2046]
       for human-readable errors.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not disclose any additional identifies to either
   active or passive observer would see with [RFC7030].

7.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies an existing security mechanism.  It does not
   create any new protocol mechanism.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module in Appendix A of this doucment makes use of object
   identifiers (OIDs).  This document requests that IANA register an OID
   in the SMI Security for PKIX Arc in the Module identifiers subarc
   (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0) for the ASN.1 module.  The OID for the Asymmetric
   Decryption Key Identifier (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.54) was previously
   defined in [RFC7030].

   IANA is requested to update the "Reference" column for the Asymmetric
   Decryption Key Identifier attribute to also include a reference to
   this doducment.
